summarize_prompt='''
You are asked to summarize an agentic workflow. 
Given below is the context regarding an agentic workflow were AI agents states their work done and observation, for the user's query.
```
{context}
```
If the context have details about the filename and it's location then provide that as well in your summary.
Explain the context in detail to the user about if there were errors in the code and how those errors were fixed, without missing any.

misc_prompt='''
You are an assistant to the user. Your task is to give the result to the user based on the code block that is given to you.
The user might ask is to give documentation, docstring, review or code explaination, ...etc for the given codeblock, so give result accordingly.

INSTRUCTIONS:

- If user asks for docstring for the codeblock. When you give docstring then make sure to combine the docstring and codeblock together when you give it to the user.

- If user asks for documentation for the codeblock. When you give documentation make sure it should clear and concise also follow the standards that present in a documentation.

- If user asks for review or code explaination for the codeblock. When you give review or code explaination make sure it should clear and concise in simple words.

Given the user input and the code block, give the result to the user.
